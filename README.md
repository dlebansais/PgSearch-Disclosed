# PgSearch

A tool to search through public data in the Project: Gorgon MMORPG. You can download the latest version (for client 439) [here](https://github.com/dlebansais/PgSearch-Disclosed/releases/download/v2.0.439.715/PgSearch-Full.exe).
There are also some [release notes](https://github.com/dlebansais/PgSearch-Disclosed/blob/master/ReleaseNotes.md).

If you have the [.NET Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-8.0.22-windows-x64-installer) already installed, [this link](https://github.com/dlebansais/PgSearch-Disclosed/releases/download/v2.0.439.715/PgSearch.exe) downloads a smaller file.
